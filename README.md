# Bank
A Java command line interface program that allows a user to create a bank account, deposit and withdraw money.
It was a great way to practice the Object Oriented Programming paradigm and at same time learn the Java static typed and explicit declaration in comparison to a dynamic typed language such as Javascript.


To run the program in Visual Studio Code:
Debug > Start Without Debugging (Control + F5) MacOS
